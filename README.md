## Overview of Analysis
Friends recently took a trip to New York City and explored the city via bicycles. This gave them an idea to open up a similar business in their hometown. They have an investor that might be interested but first we need to determine that the business would work in Iowa. Data was taken from the citibike company in New York to analyze how the business works. This helped us to determine that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. However, to solidify the proposal, one of the stakeholders wanted to see a bike trip analysis.

## Results 
Below you will find numerous visualizations in regards to the bike trip analysis. These visualizations can also be found on Tableau Public.

## Summary 
Based on the results of our analysis, there is success to be found in the bike-sharing business. A majority of the bikes are checked out for 30 minutes or less and have male riders who are subscribers. The most popular times during the week are at the start and end of the workday, between 6am-9am and 5pm-7pm. Saturdays and Sundays are more popular from 10am-7pm. The most popular starting and ending locations are in the higher populated areas. 

### Additional Visualizations 
Additional visualizations could be done to further confirm our analysis of the bike-sharing data. 
1. Use the birth year data to determine if age is correlated to a specific location or trip duration. 
2. Use the map background layer feature with the latitude and longitude to determine if there is higher utilization in certain areas based on population, race, occupation, housing, income, etc.
